# FIFA22 Player Data Pre-processing

## Dataset Description
The dataset, `Player_FIFA22.xls`, contains information about FIFA 22 players. It includes various attributes such as player name, age, nationality, club, player position, player ratings, and other relevant features.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: The dataset is examined to gain an understanding of its structure and contents. This includes identifying the number of attributes, their data types, and any missing values.

2. **Metadata Understanding**: The metadata of the dataset is reviewed to comprehend the meaning and significance of each attribute. This step aids in identifying the variables that will be considered for the analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: The following steps are performed to conduct the EDA:

    i. **Descriptive Statistics**: Descriptive statistics are calculated for the attributes in the dataset. This includes computing value ranges, frequency of values, distributions, medians, means, variances, and percentiles. These statistics provide insights into the central tendencies, variations, and distributions of the data.
    
    ii. **Visualizations**: Suitable visualizations are created to represent the corresponding statistics. Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts are utilized to provide a clear understanding of the data distribution, relationships, and patterns.

4. **Pre-processing Techniques**:

    i. **Incomplete Data**: Techniques like imputation or removal of missing values are applied to handle incomplete data. This ensures that missing values do not adversely affect the analysis.
    
    ii. **Noisy Data**: Noise in the data can be reduced using methods like filtering, or outlier detection and removal.
    
    iii. **Inconsistent Data**: Inconsistencies in the data, such as conflicting values or data format issues, are addressed by performing data cleaning and standardization processes.
